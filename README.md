## Hi there 👋

My name is Lucky, I'm a data analyst based in the UK

I like to explore and interpret many different datasets(though I prefer ones centered around the energy industry)

The tools of my trade are PostgreSQL, PowerBI, Python and Excel. I use the PgAdmin4 and Pycharm tech stack for sql and python respectively.

🔭Currently working on a project that combines PostgreSQL and PowerBI to create report on the UK's energy demand with a dataset obtained from the NESO.
